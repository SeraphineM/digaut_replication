# Replication files 

In the folder above called "Replication, Maerz 2025", you find all material needed to replicate the article 
"How practices of digital authoritarianism harm democracy" published
in Democratization ([https://doi.org/10.1080/13510347.2025.2553826](https://doi.org/10.1080/13510347.2025.2553826)).

Download the folder via the breen button `Code`, download zip. 

## All analyses are conducted in R and Quarto. ##

For replicating the entire article including all tables and figures as well as the Appendix, 
you need to download the folder, open the Quarto file "digaut_final_doc.qmd" in RStudio, install all R packages
and render the document. Alternatively, you can also replicate single tables and figures 
by running the respective R code chunks included in the Quarto file.
