@article{Davies2024,
abstract = {This article examines trends in organized violence based on new data from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP). In 2023, fatalities from organized violence decreased for the first time since the rapid increase observed in 2020, dropping from 310,000 in 2022 to 154,000 in 2023. Despite this decline, these figures represent some of the highest fatality rates recorded since the Rwandan genocide in 1994, surpassed only by those of 2022 and 2021. The decrease was primarily attributed to the end of the conflict in Ethiopia's Tigray region, which accounted for about 60% of battle-related deaths in both 2022 and 2021. Despite this positive development, the number of active state-based armed conflicts increased by three in 2023, reaching the highest level ever recorded by the UCDP, totaling 59. Non-state conflicts and one-sided violence decreased in 2023 when compared to 2022, evident in both the reduction of the active conflicts/actors and the decrease in fatalities attributed to these forms of violence. However, despite this overall decrease, fatalities resulting from non-state conflicts remained at historically high levels in 2023. Analysis of non-state conflict data spanning the past decade reveals that it comprises the ten most violent years on record. Organized crime groups have predominantly fueled this escalation. Unlike rebel groups, organized crime groups typically lack political goals and are primarily motivated by economic gain. Conflicts between these groups tend to intensify around drug smuggling routes and in urban areas, driven by shifts in alliances and leadership dynamics among the actors.},

@article{Garbe2025,
abstract = {Controlling the digital public sphere has become an important factor of authoritarianism in the twenty-first century. Authoritarian states are reluctant to accept foreign direct investment (FDI) in their internet infrastructure. However, expanding internet infrastructure is expensive, often necessitating FDI. We argue that investment from other autocracies allows incumbent dictators to provide internet access and use it for repressive purposes. Specifically, we contend that the more repressive an authoritarian regime is offline, the higher the share of FDI from other autocracies; and the more FDI from other autocracies, the less FDI prevents the internet from being used for online repression. We analyse how the level of offline repression predicts different ownership structures of internet service providers (ISPs) in authoritarian African countries, and use a difference-in-differences estimator to test how FDI from autocracies affects online repression. Using data from the Telecommunications Ownership and Control dataset, we find a positive relationship between levels of repression and share of FDI from autocracies; if at least one ISP is owned by a foreign-autocratic investor, authoritarian regimes can expand repression online. Our study provides new insights into how authoritarian collaboration enables autocracies both to accept FDI in internet infrastructure and to leverage it for repressive ends.},

@article{Michaelsen2025,
abstract = {Authoritarian governments rely on digital transnational repression to silence criticism and dissent outside their territories. Women human rights defenders and journalists in exile and in the diaspora face particular, gendered forms of digital threats that exploit their gender identity to intimidate, shame and discredit them. Based on 51 qualitative interviews with women human rights defenders originating from six countries (Azerbaijan, Eritrea, Iran, Russia, Turkey, Xinjiang/China) and residing in 17 host countries, this article investigates some key tactics of gender-based digital transnational repression. We argue that monitoring, invasive surveillance, online harassment and defamation aim to either subject the exiled women activists to the control of the repressive state again or stigmatize and distance them from their communities. By turning misogyny into a tool of political repression, authoritarian regimes are able to amplify digital attacks against exiled women activists, expanding the actor configurations involved their repressive strategies. Our findings highlight how gender-based digital transnational repression extends forms of authoritarian domination from domestic and “offline” settings into digital space and the transnational field.},

@article{Sombatpoonsiri2025,
abstract = {This article explores the escalating intersection between traditional and digital repression, focusing specifically on judicial harassment and online smear campaigns. The repression of Thailand's 2020–2021 protests is chosen as an exploratory case because the country's long-standing history of suppressing dissent through weaponized laws and propaganda primarily shaped recent dynamics of repression. We propose a two-pronged mechanism to explain the interplay between judicial harassment and online smear campaigns. Firstly, the campaigns craft narratives that delegitimize individual activists, thereby framing them as targets for legal charges. Secondly, online smear campaigns legitimize severe penalties against activists, mobilizing public endorsement of these legal actions. Our methodology involves three steps. We began with qualitative analysis, using official documents and interviews with targeted activists to assess the extent to which judicial harassment and online smear campaigns were employed as a policy. We then tracked the frequency and content of posts by pro-establishment social media accounts referencing charged protest leaders. Lastly, we compared the timelines of two activists who were frequently mentioned and faced the most charges, revealing an increase in mentions during their pre-trial detention. Ultimately, our analysis bridges the gap between studies on digital repression in autocracies and the autocratic justification of repression.},

@article{Gerschewski2021,
abstract = {Democratic regression has become a worrying phenomenon in the last years. Social science has provided a variety of explanations why democratic regimes have lost democratic regime quality. Against this backdrop, I take stock of the recent literature by putting forward two important analytical distinctions that we should make more explicit. First, I propose to classify our current explanations along the source where the cause for the malaise originated. By doing so, I introduce a distinction between erosion and decay type of arguments. While the former is a gradual process that is caused exogenously–like wind or water hitting a stone–the latter is caused endogenously–like the half-life in nuclear decay processes. Second, I draw a distinction between the endogenous or exogenous roots of the cause and the subsequent causal mechanism that connects the cause with the outcome. I outline the need for dissecting a causal mechanism into its constitutive components and highlight its underlying dimensions of temporality. Throughout the article, I use empirical case material as well as relevant secondary literature to illustrate these points.},

@article{Cho2025,
abstract = {While both liberal and illiberal regimes have sought to respond to the issue of fake news, we know little about how the latter in particular respond to this development. It seems reasonable to expect that illiberal regimes may use the pretext of a fake news epidemic to clamp down on free speech, yet not all non-democratic states go down identical paths of digital censorship and repression. To explain this puzzle, I argue that the driving factor of an illiberal state's response is the nature of its public sphere. I present a typology identifying the range and nature of fake news strategies, which classifies regime responses into two paths: an active regime response on the basis of confronting an anti-regime public sphere, or a passive regime response on the basis of encouraging the spread of pro-regime information among the public. At the end of both paths, the result is ultimately same: the forestalling of democratization. This typology is further explored using the cases of Singapore and the Philippines, to illuminate how the nature of the public sphere in each country determines the regime's response to fake news.},

The present study builds on this knowledge and showcases how the app continued to be used in a governmental operation spreading false and misleading information popularly known in Brazil as the Office of Hatred (OOH). By harnessing in-depth expert interviews with documentarians of the office's daily operations—researchers, journalists, and fact-checkers (N = 10)—this study draws up a chronology of the OOH. Via this methodological approach, we trace and chronologize events, actions, and actors associated with the OOH. Specifically, findings (a) document the rise of antipetismo and disinformation campaigns associated with attacks on the Brazilian Worker's party from 2012 until the election of Bolsonaro in 2018, (b) describe the emergence of the OOH at the heels of the election and subsequent radicalization in WhatsApp groups, (c) provide an overview of the types of disinformation that are spread on the app by the OOH, and (d) illustrate how the OOH operates by mapping key actors and places, communicative strategies, and audiences. These findings are discussed in light of ramifications that government-sponsored forms of disinformation might have in other antidemocratic polities marked by strongman populist leadership.},

@article{Luhrmann2021,
abstract = {Contemporary autocratization is typically the result of a long sequence of events and gradual processes. How can democratic actors disrupt such autocratization sequences in order to enhance democratic resilience? To address this question, this conclusion presents an ideal-typical autocratization sequence and entry points for democratic resilience. It builds on the findings of this special issue, extant research and a novel descriptive analysis of V-Party data. In the first autocratization stage, citizens' discontent with democratic institutions and parties mounts. Remedies lie in the areas of a better supply of democratic parties and processes as well as in civic education. During the second stage, anti-pluralists–actors lacking commitment to democratic norms – exploit and fuel such discontent to rise to power. In order to avoid the pitfalls of common response strategies, this article suggests “critical engagement”, which balances targeted sanctions against radicals with attempts to persuade moderate followers; and has the aim of decreasing the salience of anti-pluralists' narratives by means of democratic (voter) mobilization. Thirdly, once autocratization begins, weak accountability mechanisms and opposition actors enable democratic breakdown. Thus, resilient institutions and a united and creative opposition are the last line of democratic defense.},

This article seeks to place the study of democratic backsliding on sturdier conceptual, operational, and theoretical foundations. Conceptually, the challenge of backsliding is to define changes that take place within a political regime. Methodologically, the challenge involves measurement of intraregime changes, as alternative coding schemes change the population of units that have experienced democratic backsliding. Theoretical challenges are dual: First, despite a rich and diverse literature, we lack readily available theories to explain backsliding, and second, the theoretical debates that do exist—centered on the causes of democratic transitions, democratic breakdowns, authoritarian resilience, and democratic consolidation—remain unresolved. We consider how these theories might be called into service to explain backsliding. By doing so, the article aims to set the terms of the debate to create a common focal point around which research can coalesce.},

	abstract = {Australia's counterterrorism laws have significantly expanded the powers of its law enforcement and intelligence agencies with regard to digital surveillance. In this article, we explain and evaluate Australia's counterterrorism laws with respect to intercepting telecommunications, other forms of digital surveillance and access to encrypted communications. We focus on the statutory powers held by federal law enforcement agencies and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), Australia's domestic security intelligence agency. These powers confirm several important trends. They have further blurred the lines between intelligence and evidence and they have granted law enforcement and ASIO extraordinary powers to modify consumer technologies. They also create significant potential for conflict of laws across national boundaries. Significant strengthening of existing accountability mechanisms is needed to ensure public transparency and reduce opportunities for misuse. },

@article{Luhrmann2021,
abstract = {Contemporary autocratization is typically the result of a long sequence of events and gradual processes. How can democratic actors disrupt such autocratization sequences in order to enhance democratic resilience? To address this question, this conclusion presents an ideal-typical autocratization sequence and entry points for democratic resilience. It builds on the findings of this special issue, extant research and a novel descriptive analysis of V-Party data. In the first autocratization stage, citizens' discontent with democratic institutions and parties mounts. Remedies lie in the areas of a better supply of democratic parties and processes as well as in civic education. During the second stage, anti-pluralists–actors lacking commitment to democratic norms – exploit and fuel such discontent to rise to power. In order to avoid the pitfalls of common response strategies, this article suggests “critical engagement”, which balances targeted sanctions against radicals with attempts to persuade moderate followers; and has the aim of decreasing the salience of anti-pluralists' narratives by means of democratic (voter) mobilization. Thirdly, once autocratization begins, weak accountability mechanisms and opposition actors enable democratic breakdown. Thus, resilient institutions and a united and creative opposition are the last line of democratic defense.},

@article{Luhrmann2020,
abstract = {Accountability - constraints on a government's use of political power - is one of the cornerstones of good governance. However, conceptual stretching and a lack of reliable measures have limited cross-national research on this concept. To address this research gap, we use V-Dem data and innovative Bayesian methods to develop new indices of accountability and its subtypes: the extent to which governments are accountable to citizens (vertical accountability), other state institutions (horizontal accountability), and the media and civil society (diagonal accountability). In this article, we describe the conceptual and empirical framework underlying these indices and demonstrate their content, convergent, and construct validity. The resulting indices have unprecedented coverage (1900-present) and offer researchers and policymakers new opportunities to investigate the causes and consequences of accountability and its disaggregated subtypes. Furthermore, the methodology provides a framework for theoretically driven index construction to scholars working with cross-national panel data.},

@article{Tomini2021,
abstract = {One of the most fascinating developments in the recent comparative politics scholarship is undoubtedly the turn from the studies on the process of democratization to those on the opposite phenomenon, that is, autocratization. After the recent, initial wave of empirical studies, only recently scholars began to tackle some underlying albeit essential issues, such as the problem of conceptualization and measurement of this concept. On the pages of Democratization, a crucial debate recently emerged when Svend-Erik Skaaning reacted to the high-impact 2018 article by Anna L{\"{u}}hrmann and Staffan Lindberg. This piece aims to contribute to this stimulating debate. The main message of this piece is: don't think of a wave! Autocratization matters and deserves to be studied, even if there is no such a “third wave.” This research note claims that steering the debate on the concept of wave(s), which is of limited analytical and explanatory power, is misleading and risks taking the entire discussion down a blind alley. In the second part, the research note discusses some of the open issues of this literature, and in particular a) the very conceptualization of autocratization and b) the problem of thresholds and false positives. In the same way, the third part deals with three new areas of inquiry: c) the multi-dimensional nature of autocratization d) the multi-level dimension of autocratization and e) the opposition to autocratization.},
